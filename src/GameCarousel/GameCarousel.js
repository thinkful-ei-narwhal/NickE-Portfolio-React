Pass or fail, at the end of each run the application tracks metrics about your progress as a typer and posts them to our online leaderboards so you can compete or show off to your friends.  My team and I made this app because we love typing games but recognize that they don't provide enough diversity in their gameplay to keep them interesting and a player's typing speeds sharp.  The app is perfect for anyone who wants to play games and improve their typing speeds.",
