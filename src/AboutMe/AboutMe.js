        <p>
          I began my coding journey when I took up video game development as a
          hobby. I immediately fell in love with coding and taught myself enough
          to switch professions from a technical writer to automation engineer.
          However, I quickly realized that I was more suited for web
          development, and so I enrolled in the Thinkful Front End Web
          Development bootcamp. I regard coding as an interactive art form and
          enjoy transforming logic statements into an experience for the user.
          I'm excited to work on a team with other skilled developers in
          achieving that goal. When I'm not on the clock, youâ€™ll find me
          developing my indie video game or enjoying the outdoors while
          listening to audio books.
