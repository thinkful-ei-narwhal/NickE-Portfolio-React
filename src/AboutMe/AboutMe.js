            I began my coding journey when I took up video game development as a
            hobby. I immediately fell in love with coding and taught myself
            enough to switch professions from a technical writer to automation
            engineer.

            However, I quickly realized that I was more suited for web
            development, and so I enrolled in the Thinkful Front End Web
            Development bootcamp. I regard coding as an interactive art form and
            enjoy transforming logic statements into an experience for the user.
            I'm excited to work on a team with other skilled developers in
            achieving that goal.

            When I'm not on the clock, youâ€™ll find me developing my indie video
            game or enjoying the outdoors while listening to audio books.
